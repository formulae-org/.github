**Fōrmulæ** is a free, open source, symbolic, visual, homoiconic, high-level, multi-paradigm, arbitrary-precision programming language for scripting in academic and research environments.

The main objectives of the Fōrmulæ language are:

* To create programs with a notation closer to algorithms and mathematics
* To minimize the requirements for the programmer (only a web browser is needed)
* To have modularity of the language, packages incorporating new elements to the language can be created and dynamically/selectively added.

If you want to know more about Fōrmulæ, please refer to its website [formulae.org](https://formulae.org).

### The base program

In the repository [formulae-js](https://github.com/formulae-org/formulae-js) you can find the source code for the Fōrmulæ web application, written in JavaScript.

### The packages

With Fōrmulæ, you can create code to visualize, edit or manipulate expressions from many fields. The code is grouped in units called packages. The code for every package is hosted in the following repositories:
